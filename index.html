            <h2>Brand Identity</h2>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>I started the creative process by designing a brand identity for the business, this was done using Adobe Illustrator CC.
              The brand identity would provide a good foundation to help meet multiple business requirments such as for the website content and brand merchandise. 
              The creative assets include a brand logo, brand colour palette, and a brand icon or symbol.   
            </p></br>

              <h2>Brand Logo</h2>
              <h3>Description</h3>
              <p>After trying a few different directions for the logo, I decided that instead of something too bold or obvious, 
                I’d go for something more classic and toned down.

              <ol>
              <li>I used a font called American Typewriter because it felt reminiscent of a cool coffee shop somewhere in Brooklyn, New York or Shoreditch, London, 
                where often you can find old typewriters or other antiques which is the aesthetic I was going for.</li>
                <li>I created two seperate text boxes splitting up the words 'society' and 'coffee'.</li>
                <li>I shifted and tweaked the placement and sizing of the words until I was happy with the result.</li>
                <li>I then outlined the text using cmd+Shift+O. This outlines and groups the text together which will help avoid any font compatiblity issues.</li>
              <li>Finally, I exported the logo as an SVG (File > Export As > "My-file-name" > select format as SVG > Export). </li>

                  <h3>Description</h3>
                  <p>I wanted to create a simple icon for the company that can be used for various branding and other business collateral. 
                    I used adobe illustrator to create the icon</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>I created the shape of the bean using the ellipse tool, giving the ellipse a solid fill and solid stroke of 1px.</li>
                    <li>Using the colour palette from the style guide I created, I used the brand dark brown (#72401B) for the colour fill of the bean, 
                      and also for the solid 1px stroke.</li>
                      <li>I used the pen tool to create the crack/opening on the centre of the coffee bean, 
                        adjusting the curves until I achieved the desired shape. I finished this by applying a white solid fill and making the outline white.</li>
                      <li>I also used the pen tool to create the white curved reflection on the bottom right of the been.</li>
                      <li>Once I was satisfied with the bean, I slightly adjusted the angle giving the bean a some personality</li>
                      <li>To create the shadow, I used the ellipse tool to make a very narrow/flat ellipse and placed it at the base of the bean, behind the bean layer.</li> 
                      <li>To soften the outer part of the shadow, I added in a light grey Outer Glow effect (Effect > Stylize > Outer Glow)</li>
                      <li>I then exported the icon in an SVG format (File > Export As > "My-file-name" > select format as SVG > Export). </li>

                <h2>Brand Packaging</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Once I had the look and feel of the brand, as well as the brand creative assets, I could create brand creative 
                  that could be used on the website, merchandising and other channels such as digital marketing and online advertising.        
                </p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>I sourced an image of a generic paper bag from a royalty free stock photo image.</li>
                    <li> I began by creating a white card label that would sit over the sealed bag. </li>
                    <li>Using the branding I created I imported the merchandising logo that I created earlier and 
                      placed it on the centre of the card, reducing its opacity to 80% to give it more of an “ink on paper” look.</li>
                    <li>To create the shadow of the bag, I used the ellipse tool to create a very narrow grey ellipse. 
                      To give it more of a shadow appearance, I reduced the opacity and placed an outer glow gradient 
                      effect to the shape to make the shadow fade out.</li>
                    <li>Because the nature of the website is coffee from around the world, I wanted the packaging to give a nod to the country of origin. 
                      I sourced all the relevant images of the countries flags and placed them in the document.</li>
                    <li>I then then included text for the appropriate name of the beans and origin country</li>
                    <li>I grouped together each variation of the labels making it quick and easy for me to toggle between them and save them appropiately.</li>
                    <li></li>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>To advertise the launch of a new coffee bean flavour, I decided that a good approach would be to advertise on social media, 
                      so I designed a digital advert using Adobe Photoshop.

                      <li>I started by creating a canvas of 1080 X 1080px which is a suggested dimension provided by instagram.</li>
                      <li>For the background, I created a solid square shape using the rectangle tool and placed it on the bottom layer.</li>
                      <li>I added a radial gradient overlay using colours from the style, using the lighter brown for the center and fading to a darker brown on the exterior.</li>
                      <li>I placed the coffee bag which previously created onto the canvas with the appropriate label and packaging. It was placed as a smart object.</li>
                      <li>The coffee splash on the background was sourced as an .eps file from a royalty free website, and then placed onto the canvas as a smart object.</li>
                      <li>I also sourced the blueberries, dripping honey and apricot from Freepik. I used the magic wand tool to remove 
                        their solid backgrounds and then placed them onto the canvas.</li>
                      <li>The image of the Coffee beans was sourced online. To remove the background, I applied a layer mask and then 
                        used a combination of the pen tool, magic wand tool and brush tool for the more detailed areas.</li>
                      <li>I used the text tool to add the text layer. I applied a stroke and drop shadow to the text to give 
                        it some depth and make it pop off the image.</li>
                      <li>To export the final image for web, I performed the following actions, File > Export > Save for web > reduced quality to 90% (To reduce the file size) > Save</li>

                      adjusting and tweaking the position to how I wanted it.</li>
                      <li>Using the patch tool, I cleaned up any blemishes and spots on the image including on the plant leaves, 
                      the coffee beans and other areas.</li>
                      <li>I then duplicated the retouched image and placed a layer mask on the top layer. 
                      Using the brush with a black swatch, I cropped out the main coffee bean plant that I wanted the focus to be on.</li>
                      <li>To make the front layer of the cropped-out coffee bean plant pop. To do this I got rid of the over saturated white and yellow tones in the background, 
                      by adding a colour balance adjustment layer, increasing Cyan, Green and Blue for the midtones and then increasing Green on the shadows tone.</li>
                      <li>I then applied a Brightness/Contrast adjustment layer dropping the brightness to -60.</li>
                      <li>I then applied a Gaussian blur onto the background image, 
                      which further blurred the background putting more focus onto the Coffee bean plant which was my intention.</li>
                      <li>The image looked a little dark and dull so, I added another Brightness/Contrast layer above all of the 
                      layers and increased the overall the brightness by 50 and dropping the contrast to -20</li>
                      <li>Finally, I saved the image for web in a jpeg format at 100% quality.</li>

               traffic to the website. 
               24frame which is equal to a second I used to photoshop to create the animated gif. 
               The gif would be used for Facebook advertising and was designed to Facebooks dimension specifications</p>

            <h1>Mockups</h1>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>I created the mockups using Adobe XD. I used a 12-grid system to make sure all the 
              elements of the website were aligned and symmetrical.The columns had a width of xx and a gutter width of xx
              I started the process by creating a UI style guide so that I could easily reuse and repurpose the different UI elements such as buttons, colour palette, top nav and form elements used across the mockups. 
              I also decided to create the mobile responsive versions of the homepage, search results page and the product 
              page to see how the UI and UX journey would display on a mobile.</p>
