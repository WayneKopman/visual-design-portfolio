            <h2>Brand Identity</h2>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>I started the creative process by designing a brand identity for the business, this was done using Adobe Illustrator CC.
              The brand identity would provide a good foundation to help meet multiple business design requirments such as for the website content and brand merchandise. 
              The creative assets include a brand logo, brand colour palette, and a brand icon or symbol.   
            </p></br>

              <h2>Brand Logo</h2>
              <h3>Description</h3>
              <p>After trying a few different creative directions for the logo, I decided that instead of something too bold or obvious, 
                I’d go for something more classic and toned down.

              <ol>
              <li>I used a font called American Typewriter because it felt reminiscent of a cool coffee shop somewhere in Brooklyn, New York or Shoreditch, London, 
                where often you can find old typewriters or other antiques which is the aesthetic I was going for.</li>
                <li>I created two separate text boxes splitting up the words 'SOCIETY' and 'COFFEE'.</li>
                <li>I shifted and tweaked the placement, line height and sizing of the words until I was happy with the result.</li>
                <li>I then outlined the text using cmd+Shift+O. This outlines and groups the text together which will help avoid any font compatiblity issues.</li>
              <li>Finally, I exported the logo as an SVG (File > Export As > "My-file-name" > select format as SVG > Export). </li>

                  <h3>Description</h3>
                  <p>I wanted to create a simple icon for the company that can be used for various branded items and other business collateral. 
                    I used Adobe Illustrator to create the icon</p>

                    <li>I created the shape of the bean using the ellipse tool, giving the ellipse a solid fill and solid stroke of 1px.</li>
                    <li>Using the colour palette from the style guide I created, I used the brand dark brown (#72401B) for the colour fill of the bean, 
                      and also for the solid 1px stroke.</li>
                      <li>I used the pen tool to create the inner split in the middle of the bean, 
                        adjusting the curves until I achieved the desired shape. I finished this by applying a white solid fill and making the outline white.</li>
                      <li>I also used the pen tool to create the white curved reflection on the bottom right of the been.</li>
                      <li>Once I was satisfied with the bean, I slightly adjusted the angle by about 10° giving the bean some personality.</li>
                      <li>To create the shadow, I used the ellipse tool to make a very narrow/flat ellipse and placed it at the base of the bean, behind its layer.</li> 
                      <li>To soften the outer part of the shadow, I added in a light grey Outer Glow effect (Effect > Stylize > Outer Glow)</li>
                      <li>I then exported the icon in an SVG format (File > Export As > "My-file-name" > select format as SVG > Export). </li>

                <h2>Brand Packaging</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Once I had the look and feel of the brand, as well as the creative assets, I could create designs for the website, 
                  merchandising and other channels such as digital marketing and online advertising. 
                  I started with creating packaging for the coffee beans that I would be able to use in multiple areas of the business.

                    <li>I sourced an image of a generic paper bag from a royalty free stock photo website.</li>
                    <li> I created a 1200x1200px canvas placing the bag on a new layer. I used the rectangle tool for the white card label that sits over the sealed bag, 
                      applying a slight drop shadow with an opacity of 10% to give it some depth and bring it to life.</li>
                    <li>I imported in the merchandisie logo from the branding that I created, and
                      placed it on the centre of the card, reducing its opacity to 80% to give it more of an “ink on paper” look.</li>
                    <li>To create the shadow of the bag, I used the ellipse tool making a very narrow grey ellipse. 
                      To give it more of a shadow appearance, I reduced the opacity and placed an outer glow gradient 
                      effect to the shape to make the shadow fade out giving it the feathered appearance.</li>
                    <li>The nature of the website is coffee from around the world, so I wanted the packaging to give a nod to the country of origin. 
                      I sourced all the flags of the relevant countries and placed them in the document over the white label, flipping them to 90 degress, and adjusting their dimensions for purpose.</li>
                    <li>I then included text using the brand's font, American Typewriter, for the corresponding name of the beans and origin country making the country name bold.</li>
                    <li>I grouped together each variation of the labels individually making it quick and easy for me to toggle between the flavours, and save them appropiately.</li>
                    <li>For example, I was able to bulk 'Save for web' the different products in various dimensions for the website shop page, the product info page and more.</li>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>To advertise the launch of a new coffee bean flavour, I decided that a good approach would be to advertise on social media, 
                      so I designed a digital advert using Adobe Photoshop.
                    </p>

                      <li>I started by creating a canvas of 1080 X 1080px which is the instagram suggested dimensions for their square photo adverts.</li>
                      <li>For the background, I created a solid square shape using the rectangle tool and placed it on the bottom layer.</li>
                      <li>I added a radial gradient overlay to the background adopting colours from the style guide, using the lighter brown for the center and fading to the darker brown on the exterior of the gradient.</li>
                      <li>I placed the coffee bag previously created, onto the canvas with the relevant label. It was placed as a smart object.</li>
                      <li>The coffee splash on the background was sourced as an .eps file from a royalty free website, and then placed onto the canvas as a smart object, then adjusted as required.</li>
                      <li>I sourced the blueberries, dripping honey, and apricot from a royalty free stock website. I used the magic wand tool to remove 
                        their solid backgrounds and then placed them onto the canvas.</li>
                      <li>The image of the coffee beans was also sourced online. To remove the background, I applied a layer mask and then 
                        used a combination of the pen tool, magic wand tool and brush tool for the more detailed areas.</li>
                      <li>I used the text tool to add the text layers. I applied a stroke and drop shadow to the text to give 
                        it some depth and make it pop off the image.</li>
                      <li>To export the final image for web, I performed the following actions, File > Export > Save for web > reduced quality to 90% (To reduce the file size) > Save</li>

                    <p>I wanted to showcase the launch of a new coffee bean range on the website, so I decided to create an alternative homepage hero banner rotation for the homepage,

                      <li>Using the rectangle tool, I created the background and added a radial gradient overlay using brand colours.</li>
                      <li>I then placed a stock image of coffee beans over the background layer, then applied a Multiply setting to the layer giving it the seen effect.</li>
                      <li>I then place a smart object of coffee bean bag on its own layer.</li>
                      <li>I then right clicked and did a "Layer via copy" 6 timee. This method would make the copies independent from the original smart object.</li>
                      <li>Then I was able to go into each individual smart object and change each bag to the correct name and flag (hidden in layers on the original smart object).</li>
                      <li>I then adjusted the angles of the coffee bags to give it a fun, lively feel.</li>
                      <li>Once complete, I used 'Save for web' to export it.</li>

                      <li>I created an artboard in Photoshop with dimensions of 1920px X 550px and placed the source image onto the canvas, 
                      adjusting and tweaking the position to how I wanted it.</li>
                      <li>Using the patch tool, I cleaned up any blemishes and spots on the image including on the plant leaves, 
                      the coffee beans and other areas.</li>
                      <li>I then duplicated the retouched image and placed a layer mask on the top layer. 
                      Using the brush with a black swatch, I cropped out the main coffee bean plant that I wanted the focus to be on.</li>
                      <li>To make the front layer of the cropped-out coffee bean plant pop. To do this I got rid of the over saturated white and yellow tones in the background, 
                      by adding a colour balance adjustment layer, increasing Cyan, Green and Blue for the midtones and then increasing Green on the shadows tone.</li>
                      <li>I then applied a Brightness/Contrast adjustment layer dropping the brightness to -60.</li>
                      <li>I then applied a Gaussian blur onto the background image, 
                      which further blurred the background putting more focus onto the coffee bean plant which was my intention.</li>
                      <li>The image looked a little dark and dull so, I added another Brightness/Contrast layer above all of the 
                      layers and increased the overall the brightness by 50 and dropping the contrast to -20</li>
                      <li>Finally, I saved the image for web in a jpeg format at 100% quality.</li>

            <p>I decided to create an animated gif that could be used for social media marketing purposes on platforms

                <ol>
                  <li>I created a banner of 1200 x 628px, which is Facebook's dimension specifications for such adverts.</li>
                  <li>To create the background, I used the rectangle tool, creating a rectangle the size of the canvas.</li>
                  <li>I placed a custom variation of the coffee bean bag which I customised specifically for the advert, onto the canvas on it's own layer as a smart object. </li>
                  <li>I then placed the image of the falling coffee beans which I sourced from a royalty free website onto its own layer.</li>
                  <li>I repurposed the image of the beans that rise up from the bottom of the frame, from the instagram advert I previously created.</li>
                  <li>I placed them outside of the frame directly above the coffee bean bag.</li>
                  <li>Using the timeline feature in photoshop, I duplicated frame one, and in the new frame, I moved the coffee beans to the bottom of the artboard.</li>
                  <li>I then selected both frames and created a tween, giving the coffee beans the falling effect.</li>
                  <li>I reused the cropped-out coffee beans from the Instagram advert previously created, and placed them onto my canvas as a smart object.</li>
                  <li>Doing the reverse of what I did for the falling coffee beans, I created a tween of the coffee beans coming up into the canvas.</li>
                  <li>I made the title sequence by creating "Fresh coffee Beans" and "Delivered to you" on two seperate text layers, applying a drop shadow to them.</li>
                  <li>I then created individual tweens for both text layers, making them come in from either side.</li>       
                <li>The animation is set to loop forever. I also included a 5 second pause on the final frame, giving the user the chance to digest “The full picture” </li>
                <li>When saving for web, I dropped the colours down to 128bit from 256bit, and also reduced the dimensions by 20% giving me a final image of 960 × 502px, so the aspect ratio was still maintained. 
                  I did this to obtain a smaller file size. The end result was still fit for purposes.</li>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>I created the mockups using Adobe XD. I started the process by creating a UI style guide so that I could easily reuse and repurpose the different UI elements such as buttons, colour palette, top nav and form elements across the mockups. 
              I also decided to create the mobile responsive versions of the homepage, search results page and the product 
              page, as well as the Homepage Design for Tablet, to see how the UI and UX journey should display on these devices.</p>
